* Casual

Casual is a project to re-imagine the primary user interface for Emacs using keyboard-driven menus.

Emacs has many commands that are easy to forget if not used frequently. Menus are a user interface (UI) affordance that offers discoverability and recognition. While menus are commonly associated with mouse-driven UI, the inclusion of [[https://github.com/magit/transient][Transient]] in Emacs core allows for building menus that are keyboard-driven instead. This appeals to users that prefer keyboard-driven workflows.

Casual organizes itself primarily around the different built-in modes Emacs provides. For each mode Casual supports, there is a bespoke designed library of Transient menus for that mode's command set.

Casual has no aims to be a mutually exclusive user interface. All existing user interfaces to commands (keybinding, mini-buffer prompt, mouse menus) are still available to the user.

To learn more about the motivations and design considerations for Casual as well as seeing it at work, please watch the presentation [[https://emacsconf.org/2024/talks/casual/][“Re-imagining the Emacs User Experience with Casual Suite”]] from EmacsConf 2024.

** Goals
- To provide a keyboard-driven menu UI toolkit for common Emacs commands.
- To allow for casual discovery and use of infrequently used Emacs commands.
- To be a frequently used interface to the modes Casual does support.

** Non-Goals
- Full coverage of all Emacs commands. Casual is not intended to be a power user tool nor is it intended to be a replacement for mouse-driven menus. Casual has no intent to exhaustively cover all modes available in Emacs with keyboard-driven menus.
- Strict adherence to Emacs command naming. While Casual is *mostly* in alignment with Emacs command naming, there are cases where it will make an opinionated change if the name is deemed too vague or idiomatic.
- No intention is made by Casual to help on-board users to the existing default bindings of a mode, nor to cater to users who already know them. That said, many existing default Emacs bindings are replicated in Casual. Such correspondence should be considered incidental.
- UX Stability (for now). Given that Casual is early in its life-cycle, expect changes to its user experience in terms of menu hierarchy and keybinding choices in future releases.
  
Editorially, all design decisions for Casual are ultimately the opinion of Charles Y. Choi.

** Upgrading to Casual 2.x
If you have been using an earlier version 1.x of Casual, thank you. Please use the following guidance:

*** If you do not use ~use-package~ to configure Casual
Before installing Casual, you should update all of your existing Casual packages. This is most easily done via the [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Package-Menu.html][package menu buffer]]. After updating your packages, install the ~casual~ package.

Migrate your existing Casual packages from 1.x to 2.x by running the following commands:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
M-x load-library casual
M-x casual-upgrade-base-to-version-2
#+END_SRC

Any Casual v1.x packages that have been superseded by this package will be uninstalled.

While not necessary, it is recommended to run ~M-x package-autoremove~ to purge any dangling dependent packages. Cautious readers can choose to audit any packages that are targeted to be removed.

*** If you have used ~use-package~ to configure Casual
For version 2.x going forward, I (Charles Choi) have decided to not offer any documented guidance on using ~use-package~ to configure Casual due my lack of expertise in using it. I leave it to more skilled readers to determine how to best use [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/use-package/][use-package]] for their configuration. Please also note that this is not a prohibition on using ~use-package~ with Casual. I am simply admitting that I don't know how to use it. 

That said, if you have used ~:ensure t~ to install a superseded package, you /must/ remove that configuration. After doing so, please follow the above instructions for installing ~casual~.

** A Note on Package Dependencies
Casual requires a recent installation of Transient 0.6.0+ from either [[https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/transient.html][ELPA]] or [[https://melpa.org/#/transient][MELPA]]. If your version of Emacs is ≤ 30 but also includes Transient as a built-in package, you will need to set the customizable variable ~package-install-upgrade-built-in~ to ~t~ to enable updating it via ~package.el~.  Set this variable and proceed with installing Casual.  Alternately invoking ~package-install~ with a prefix (~C-u~) will temporarily coerce the update of dependent built-in packages (example: ~C-u M-x package-install~ ~casual~).

If you already have the latest version of Magit installed (via [[https://elpa.nongnu.org/nongnu/magit.html][non-GNU ELPA]] or [[https://melpa.org/#/magit][MELPA]]), you can bypass the above instruction as Magit already includes the Transient package as a dependency.


* Customization

Users who wish to extend or alter existing Casual menus can do so via the mechanisms offered by the Transient package (see [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/transient.html#Modifying-Existing-Transients][Modifying Existing Transients]]).

Casual menus can also be configured to use Unicode symbols for labels. This is controlled by the variable ~casual-lib-use-unicode~ which can be customized via a mode's settings menu. If ~casual-lib-use-unicode~ is set to ~t~, it is also recommended that the variable ~transient-align-variable-pitch~ also be set to ~t~. 


* Asks
As Casual is new, we are looking for early adopters! Your [[https://github.com/kickingvegas/casual/discussions][feedback]] is welcome as it will likely impact Casual's evolution, particularly with regards to UI.

* Common Menu Actions
Casual is built using Transient menus and as such adopts its default behavior.

Each menu item has a /key/ and a /label/. The /key/ is what is typed by the user to select the menu item. A key can be prefixed with a meta (M-) or control (C-) key.

Transient supports nested menus. Exiting a menu can be done in two ways:
- ~C-g~ will exit the current sub-menu and return you back to its parent menu.
- ~C-q~ will exit you completely from a Transient menu stack.

If a mouse is available, a menu item can be selected by moving the mouse cursor over its label and pressing down button 1.

Pressing the ~?~ key or ~C-h~ will toggle help for all the menu items. Press the key of interest to get help for it.

When a Transient menu is raised, a prefix argument (~C-u~) and an optional argument can be entered before selecting a menu item.

* Development
For users who wish to help contribute to Casual or personally customize it for their own usage, please read the [[docs/developer.org][developer documentation]].

* Sponsorship
If you enjoy using Casual, consider making a modest financial contribution to help support its development and maintenance.

[[https://www.buymeacoffee.com/kickingvegas][file:docs/images/default-yellow.png]]

* See Also
While the package ~casual~ focuses on user interfaces for built-in Emacs modes, there are other third party packages which receive the “Casual” treatment. Two such packages are:

- [[https://github.com/kickingvegas/casual-avy][Casual Avy]] (Elisp package: ~casual-avy~)
  - An interface for the highly capable Avy navigation package.
- [[https://github.com/kickingvegas/casual-symbol-overlay][Casual Symbol Overlay]] (Elisp package: ~casual-symbol-overlay~)
  - An interface for the Symbol Overlay package.

Users interested in getting all current and future Casual interfaces for both built-in and third party packages should install [[https://github.com/kickingvegas/casual-suite][Casual Suite]], which includes all of the above packages including ~casual~.
