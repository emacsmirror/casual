Casual Man is a user interface for ~Man-mode~, a Man page reader.

* Install

In your initialization file, bind the Transient ~casual-man-tmenu~ to your key binding of preference.

#+begin_src elisp :lexical no
  (require 'casual-man) ; optional
  (keymap-set Man-mode-map "C-o" #'casual-man-tmenu)
#+end_src

~casual-man-tmenu~ deviates from the default bindings of ~Man-mode-map~ as shown in the table below.

| Default Binding | Casual Binding | Command                               | Notes                                                   |
|-----------------+----------------+---------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------|
| n               | [              | Man-previous-section                  | Make consistent with Casual Dired and IBuffer behavior. |
| p               | ]              | Man-next-section                      | Make consistent with Casual Dired and IBuffer behavior. |
| k               | K              | Man-kill                              | Reserve k for navigation.                               |
|                 | k              | previous-line                         |                                                         |
|                 | j              | next-line                             |                                                         |
|                 | n              | casual-lib-browser-forward-paragraph  | Use to navigate paragraph forward.                      |
|                 | p              | casual-lib-browser-backward-paragraph | Use to navigate paragraph backward.                     |

The following keybindings are recommended to support consistent behavior between ~Man-mode~ and ~casual-man-tmenu~.

#+begin_src elisp :lexical no
  (keymap-set Man-mode-map "n" #'casual-lib-browse-forward-paragraph)
  (keymap-set Man-mode-map "p" #'casual-lib-browse-backward-paragraph)
  (keymap-set Man-mode-map "[" #'Man-previous-section)
  (keymap-set Man-mode-map "]" #'Man-next-section)
  (keymap-set Man-mode-map "j" #'next-line)
  (keymap-set Man-mode-map "k" #'previous-line)
  (keymap-set Man-mode-map "K" #'Man-kill)
  (keymap-set Man-mode-map "o" #'casual-man-occur-options)
#+end_src

* Usage

** Basic Usage

The Man page reader can be invoked via ~M-x man~, where the user is prompted for a search key. This search key is typically the name of a command that has an associated Man page. In the Man page window, pressing ~C-o~ (or your binding of preference) will raise the menu ~casual-man-tmenu~.

The following sections are offered in the menu:

- Navigation :: Navigation commands with the document.
- Paragraph :: Navigation commands by paragraph.
- Section :: Navigation commands by section.
- Link :: Jump to other Man pages referenced in the current Man page.
- Page :: If the Man page reader is configured to display all manual pages for a given search key, navigation commands for multiple pages is provided.

*** Options Navigation

~casual-man-tmenu~ provides the menu item ‘o’ which runs the command ~casual-man-occur-options~. This will invoke ~occur~ with a regexp that searches for command line options (for example, "--foo", "-a") that can be navigated via the ~occur~ interface.

*** Settings

By default, the Man page reader will /not/ display all manual pages for given search key. This can be changed in the Settings menu ~casual-man-settings-tmenu~ that can be invoked by pressing ‘,’ in ~casual-man-tmenu~. 

Press ‘s’ and configure ~Man-switches~ to have the value "-a" to get all manual pages.

*** Unicode Symbol Support
By enabling “Use Unicode Symbols” from the Settings menu, Casual Man will use Unicode symbols as appropriate in its menus.
