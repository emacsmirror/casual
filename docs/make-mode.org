Casual Make is a user interface for ~make-mode~, a mode tailored for editing a Makefile.

In your initialization file, bind the Transient ~casual-make-tmenu~ to your key binding of preference. Two suggested bindings are {{{kbd(M-m)}}} or {{{kbd(C-c m)}}}.

It is recommended that some basic knowledge of the *make* command is known before using Casual Make.

When in a Makefile buffer, use {{{kbd(M-m)}}} (or your binding of choice) to raise the menu ~casual-make-tmenu~. You will be presented with a menu with the following sections:

- Edit :: Commands for editing the makefile. Note that the backslash and comment commands require a region to be selected.

- Pickup as targets :: Commands for synchronizing ~make-mode~ with the target definitions in the makefile. Use these commands to refresh the known list of targets.

- Misc :: Miscellaneous commands related to working with a makefile.

- Navigate :: Commands to support navigation within the makefile.

Unless you edit makefiles frequently, it is unlikely to recall what an automatic variable declaration means. Casual Make provides the command ~casual-make-identify-autovar-region~ to identify a region-selected automatic variable via the menu item “{{{kbd(.)}}} Identify Auto Var” in ~casual-make-tmenu~. A short description of the automatic variable is shown in the mini-buffer.

*** Makefile Type Selection
#+CINDEX: Makefile Type Selection
#+VINDEX: casual-make-mode-select-tmenu

As there are different variants of *make* and makefile formats, you can configure the mode for different specific makefile types. This can be done by selecting “{{{kbd(t)}}} Makefile Type›” in ~casual-make-tmenu~.

*** Automatic Variables
#+CINDEX: Automatic Variables
#+VINDEX: casual-make-automatic-variables-tmenu

Casual Make provides a menu to enter GNU Make-style [[info:make#Automatic Variables][automatic variables]].  Note that each keybinding is identical to the automatic variable it represents to both reinforce its declaration and to avoid making another mapping. This menu is available from the menu item “{{{kbd(a)}}} Automatic Variables›”  in ~casual-make-tmenu~.

*** Make Unicode Symbol Support
By enabling “{{{kbd(u)}}} Use Unicode Symbols” from the Settings menu, Casual Make will use Unicode symbols as appropriate in its menus.
