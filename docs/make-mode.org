* Casual Make

Casual Make is a user interface for ~make-mode~, a mode tailored for editing a Makefile.

[[file:images/casual-make-screenshot.png]]

* Install

In your initialization file, bind the Transient ~casual-make-tmenu~ to your key binding of preference. Two suggested bindings are ~M-m~ or ~C-c m~.

#+begin_src elisp :lexical no
  (require 'casual-make) ; optional
  (keymap-set makefile-mode-map "M-m" #'casual-make-tmenu)
#+end_src

* Usage

It is recommended that some basic knowledge of the *make* command is known before using Casual Make.

** Basic Usage

When in a Makefile buffer, use ~M-m~ (or your binding of choice) to raise the menu ~casual-make-tmenu~. You will be presented with a menu with the following sections:

- Edit

  Commands for editing the makefile. Note that the backslash and comment commands require a region to be selected.

- Pickup as targets

  Commands for synchronizing ~make-mode~ with the target definitions in the makefile. Use these commands if trying to insert a target (via the ':' binding) does not include a target you have recently entered.

- Misc

  Miscellaneous commands related to working with a makefile.

- Navigate

  Commands to support navigation within the makefile.

** Makefile Type Selection

As there are different variants of *make* and makefile formats, you can configure the mode for different specific makefile types. This can be done by selecting the ~t~ keybinding in ~casual-make-tmenu~.

** Automatic Variables

Casual Make provides a menu to enter GNU Make-style [[https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Automatic-Variables.html][automatic variables]].  Note that each keybinding is identical to the automatic variable it represents to both reinforce its declaration and to avoid making another mapping. This menu is available from the 'i' keybinding in ~casual-make-tmenu~.

[[file:images/casual-make-automatic-variables-screenshot.png]]

Unless you edit makefiles frequently, it is very unlikely to be able to recall what an automatic variable declaration means. Casual Make provides the command ~casual-make-identify-autovar-region~ to identify a selected automatic variable via the binding ~i~ in ~casual-make-tmenu~. A short description of the automatic variable is shown in the mini-buffer.

** Unicode Symbol Support
By enabling “Use Unicode Symbols” from the Settings menu, Casual Make will use Unicode symbols as appropriate in its menus.

* Sponsorship
If you enjoy using Casual Make, consider making a modest financial contribution to help support its development and maintenance.
