The main menu for Casual I-Search is organized into the following sections:

- Edit Search String :: Commands to edit the search string. The type/extent of the string (word, symbol, line, thing) can be specified here.

- Replace :: Invoke ~query-replace~ or ~query-replace-regexp~ on matched strings.

- Toggle :: Commands to configure the type of search.

- Misc :: Miscellaneous commands. From here the search string can be fed into ~occur~ or be highlighted.

- Navigation :: Navigation commands for matched strings.

When in search mode (typically via the keybinding {{{kbd(C-s)}}} or {{{kbd(C-r)}}}), pressing the keybinding {{{kbd(C-o)}}} (or binding of your preference) will raise the Transient menu ~casual-isearch-tmenu~. Once raised, only the /I-Search/ commands in the *Replace* and *Misc* sections will automatically dismiss the menu when selected. All other /I-Search/ commands will /not/ dismiss the menu.

Note that editing the search text via ~isearch-edit-string~ will enter a recursive editing mode that is normally exited when pressing the return (~RET~) key.

Use {{{kbd(C-g)}}} to dismiss this Transient menu.
