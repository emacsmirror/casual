The command ~casual-timezone-planner~ will prompt the user for one or more time zones and a date to compare in tabular form the local time with the zones selected. Multiple time zones are comma-separated.

In this table, the point can be navigated using the {{{kbd(p)}}}, {{{kbd(n)}}}, {{{kbd(TAB)}}}, and {{{kbd(S-TAB)}}} bindings.

Use the {{{kbd(T)}}} binding to copy the timestamp under the current point to the ~kill-ring~. The {{{kbd(t)}}} binding will copy all timestamps on the current line to the ~kill-ring~.
