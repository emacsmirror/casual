* Casual Image
An interface for viewing an image file with [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Image-Mode.html#Image-Mode][image-mode]]. Resizing an image is supported if ImageMagick 6 or 7 is installed. This interface deviates significantly with naming conventions used by ~image-mode~ to be more in alignment with conventional image editing tools.

* Usage

** Command Naming

Casual Image makes a number of opinionated changes to the naming of commands provided by ~image-mode~. 

The table below shows the mapping between names used by Casual to commands provided by ~image-mode~.

| Casual Name           | Image Mode Name                   | Notes                                                                                            |
|-----------------------+-----------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Zoom In               | ~image-increase-size~               | “Zoom” is more commonly used.                                                                    |
| Zoom Out              | ~image-decrease-size~               | “Zoom” is more commonly used.                                                                    |

| Rotate Clockwise 90°x | ~image-transform-set-rotation~      | Rotation command is absolute and only works in increments of 90°.                                |
| % of Original         | ~image-transform-set-percent~       | Percent command is absolute in that it computes from the original image size.                    |
| Crop                  | ~image-crop~                        | Command modifies image.                                                                          |
| Fill                  | ~image-cut~                         | Command modifies image. This command is primarily a fill operation, so is renamed appropriately. |
| Set Fill Color        | ~image-cut-color~                   | This variable supports a fill operation, so is renamed appropriately.                            |

** Resize

If ImageMagick (version 6 or 7) is installed, Casual Image can resize an image using it. The Transient ~casual-image-resize-tmenu~ is a streamlined interface to the ImageMagick ~-resize~ function.

Note that if the image file has been modified, the resize interface will be disabled. Save the image file before resizing.

[[file:images/casual-image-resize-screenshot.png]]

*** Options
- (g) Geometry - [[https://imagemagick.org/script/command-line-processing.php#geometry][ImageMagick specifier]] for the resize geometry.
- (o) Output to another file - If enabled, then the user will be prompted for a different output file, else it will /irreversibly/ update the current image file.
- (t) Type - Specify if /adaptive/ or /interpolative/ resizing should be used. If nothing is specified then /standard/ resizing is used.

** Unicode Symbol Support

By enabling “Use Unicode Symbols” from the Settings menu, Casual Image will use Unicode symbols as appropriate in its menus.
