* Usage
** Basic Usage

Whenever the ~calendar~ window (showing three months) is raised, the Casual user interface for it can be invoked via the command ~casual-calendar~. This command is typically bound to a keybinding (e.g. ~C-o~). The menu displayed will offer the following activities:

- Navigation commands organized by time (day, week, month, year).
- Conversion commands to different calendar systems.
- Holiday-related commands.
- Diary-related commands.
- Almanac commands.

Also made available is access to a Settings menu (more below) and to the Info documentation for ~calendar~.

** Diary & Goto Menu

From the main menu, choosing “(D) Diary & Goto›” will present choices for diary event insertion and to “goto” a particular date via different specifications.

** Calendar System Date Conversion
Calendar supports conversion of dates from Gregorian (default) to a number of different calendar systems. Choose "(c) Conversions›" from the main menu to select from a list of such calendars.

 Supported calendar systems:

- Astronomical
- Bahá’í
- Ethiopic
- French Revolutionary
- Hebrew
- Islamic
- Julian
- Lunar (Chinese)
- Mayan
- Persian

Selecting a calendar system will raise a menu that offers date conversion commands between it and the Gregorian system. In the screenshot below, the Lunar (Chinese) calendar system menu is shown. 

To convert a Gregorian date to Lunar (Chinese):

1. Move cursor (point) in Calendar window to desired date. (The command “(g) Goto…” can be used to accomplish this.)
2. Choose “(c) Date at Cursor”.

To convert a Lunar (Chinese) date to Gregorian:

1. Choose “(G) Goto…” and follow the prompts.

Certain non-Gregorian calendar systems are supported by the diary (Bahá’í, Hebrew, Islamic, Lunar (Chinese)). For such systems, their menus will offer choices to insert diary events.

Note that inserting non-Gregorian diary events require configuration of the variables ~diary-nongregorian-listing-hook~ and ~diary-nongregorian-marking-hook~ as detailed in [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Non_002dGregorian-Diary.html][(emacs) Non-Gregorian Diary]]. 

Both of these variables can be configured from the Calendar Settings menu.

** Settings Menu
From the main menu, choosing “(,) Settings” will provide a menu of frequently configured calendar and diary-related variables.

By enabling “Use Unicode Symbols” from the Settings menu, Casual Calendar will use Unicode symbols as appropriate in its menus.
