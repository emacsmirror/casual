* Usage

** Basic Usage

Eshell can be invoked via ~M-x eshell~. In any Eshell window, pressing ~C-o~ (or your binding of preference) will raise the menu ~casual-eshell-tmenu~.

The following sections are offered in the menu:

- Input :: Commands supporting input to the current prompt. 
- Argument :: Commands supporting arguments in the current prompt.
- Prompt :: Navigation of previous prompt commands.
- Output :: Commands related to display of prompt. Commands marked with an ~n~ superscript support an optional prefix (~C-u~) value.
- Misc :: Miscellaneous commands.

If a process is running, a section for managing signals to send to it is provided.
  
- Process :: Signal commands to send to the process.
